# JINT_paper_codes

This project has the code for the simulation results produced in the JINT paper which is under review. This problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Programming problem and solved using Gurobi. This problem is also solved using Constraint Programming (CP) method and OR-Tools' constraint programming solver is used for solving this problem.

The three-tiered optimization code is as follows:

# Kmeans_clustering_2cluster_3clustdist_bounds_one.py: Using unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to cluster the mission points on the area into 2 clusters. Each cluster has its own cluster centroid.
